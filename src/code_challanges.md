# Beginner Python Coding Puzzles

## 1. FizzBuzz
Write a program that:
- Prints numbers from 1 to 50.
- For multiples of 3, print "Fizz".
- For multiples of 5, print "Buzz".
- For multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

**Why It's Fun**: Teaches loops, conditionals, and logic!

## 2. Guess the Number Game
Write a program that:
- Generates a random number between 1 and 20.
- Lets the user guess the number, giving hints like "Too high" or "Too low".
- Ends when the user guesses the correct number.

**Why It's Fun**: Introduces randomness, loops, and user input.
